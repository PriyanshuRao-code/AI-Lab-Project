# Identifying Hazardous Near-Earth Asteroids  

## Overview  
This project classifies near-Earth asteroids as **hazardous or non-hazardous** using **machine learning**. The dataset, sourced from **NASA’s NeoWs**, includes asteroid details like size, velocity, and orbital data.  

## Dataset  
- **Key Features**: Orbital parameters, size, velocity, and approach distance.  
- **Target**: Binary classification (Hazardous/Non-Hazardous).  

## Methodology  
1. **Preprocessing** – Cleaning and normalizing data.  
2. **Feature Selection** – Identifying important asteroid properties.  
3. **Model Training** – Using classification algorithms.  
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, and F1-score.  

## Usage  
Clone the repo and run the script:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyanshuRao-code/AI-Lab-Project.git
