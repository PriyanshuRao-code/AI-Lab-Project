# AI-Lab-Project
This project classifies near-Earth asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous using machine learning. The dataset from NASAâ€™s NeoWs includes asteroid size, velocity, orbit, and approach data. The model preprocesses data, selects key features, and trains classifiers to predict hazards. Results help in asteroid threat detection for planetary defense. ðŸš€
